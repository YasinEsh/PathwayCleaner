# PathwayCleaner
PathwayCleaner is a Python-based tool designed to streamline and refine pathway enrichment analysis results. It identifies overlapping pathway terms based on shared genes, filters redundant entries, and visualizes the most statistically significant pathways for better interpretability

## Features
- Identifies overlapping pathway terms based on gene overlap (≥65% overlap).
- Retains the most statistically significant terms based on adjusted p-values.
- Generates a publication-ready visualization of the top 10 pathways.

## Requirements
- Python >= 3.*
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn

Install the dependencies with:
```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn
